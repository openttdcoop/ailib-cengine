- Add more error messages return

v4:
- bugfixes

v5:
- new functions : RestrictLength_Vehicle, RestrictLength_Wagons, IsMultiEngine
- a change to EngineIsKnown private function, now return true if != -1 (was == -2 before).
So nothing you should care. But if you want do tricky things with it, dictatorai change it to a vehicleID to prevent others vehicle with that engine going to depot for upgrade. So as soon a vehicle exist, it has pass tests, and this value can be changed safely to anything except -1 now
- fix bug with GetLength

* GetNumberOfWagons -> VehicleGetNumberOfWagons
* GetWagonFromVehicle -> VehicleGetRandomWagon
* GetBestRailType -> RailTypeGetFastestType

* GetTrainMaximumSpeed -> RailTypeGetSpeed (it doesn't do what GetTrainMaximumSpeed was doing, but it replace it and can do the same)
* RestrictLength_Wagons -> GetMaxWagons
- A lot of new functions: VehicleGetWeight, VehicleGetMaxTractiveEffort, VehicleGetMaxPower, VehicleGetRailTypeUse, VehicleGetMaxSpeed, VehicleIsUnderpower, GetDepotType, DirtyEngineCache, GetEngineList
