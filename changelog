- a change to EngineIsKnown private function, now return true if != -1 (was == -2 before).
So nothing you should care. But if you want do tricky things with it, dictatorai change it to a vehicleID to prevent others vehicle with that engine going to depot for upgrade. So as soon a vehicle exist, it has pass tests, and this value can be changed safely to anything except -1 now
- fix bug with GetLength
