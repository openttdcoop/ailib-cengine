v1: 
Initial.

v2: 
- new functions : GetNumberOfLocomotive, GetNumberOfWagons, GetWagonFromVehicle, WagonCompatibilityTest
- bugfixes

v3:
- Add more error messages return

v4:
- bugfixes

v5:
- new functions : RestrictLength_Vehicle, RestrictLength_Wagons, IsMultiEngine
- a change to EngineIsKnown private function, now return true if != -1 (was == -2 before).
So nothing you should care. But if you want do tricky things with it, dictatorai change it to a vehicleID to prevent others vehicle with that engine going to depot for upgrade. So as soon a vehicle exist, it has pass tests, and this value can be changed safely to anything except -1 now
- fix bug with GetLength

v6:
- bugfixes

v7:
- bugfixes

v8:
- A lot of functions has been renamed to better match a logic, now functions using a vehicle_id as parameter are named Vehicle*
* UpdateEngineProperties -> VehicleUpdateEngineProperties
* CreateVehicle -> VehicleCreate (while this function doesn't use a vehicle_id, the name is better)
* IsMultiEngine -> VehicleIsMultiEngine
* GetNumberOfLocomotive -> VehicleGetNumberOfLocomotive
* GetNumberOfWagons -> VehicleGetNumberOfWagons
* GetWagonFromVehicle -> VehicleGetRandomWagon
* GetBestRailType -> RailTypeGetFastestType
* RestrictLength_Vehicle -> VehicleRestrictLength
* GetTrainMaximumSpeed -> RailTypeGetSpeed (it doesn't do what GetTrainMaximumSpeed was doing, but it replace it and can do the same)
* RestrictLength_Wagons -> GetMaxWagons
- A lot of new functions: VehicleGetWeight, VehicleGetMaxTractiveEffort, VehicleGetMaxPower, VehicleGetRailTypeUse, VehicleGetMaxSpeed, VehicleLackPower, GetDepotType, DirtyEngineCache, GetEngineList
- fixing bad comment on return value of GetNumberOfWagons

v9:
- fix invalid fastest railtype return when no engine is given (we were giving the slowest)
- Add a function to query money: cEngineLib.SetMoneyCallBack (see readme about money)
- fix a bug where we don't set the loco engine railtype (while wagon was set) ending with sometimes a bad couple chosen
- RailTypeGetSpeed will now return the speed of the fastest railtype if call with -1 parameter
- Default filter now use HasPowerOnRail instead of CanRunOnRail against locos & wagons: the former can answer to both, the later only answer to wagons (i don't think anyone will need a loco that is not powered but that could run on some railtype)
